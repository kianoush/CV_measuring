Computer vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data from the world around them. It involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to analyze images and videos and extract useful information from them.
One application of computer vision is object measurement. By using computer vision algorithms, it's possible to automatically detect and measure the size and shape of objects in an image or video. This can be useful in a variety of fields, such as manufacturing, quality control, and robotics.
For example, in manufacturing, computer vision can be used to measure the dimensions of products as they move along a production line, ensuring that they meet quality standards.
In the software I created, the left window displays real-time video, while the right window shows how computer vision algorithms can recognize and measure objects with high accuracy.
